# Hangman

Using `PlutoUI`, it's really easy to code up a simple game of Hangman.
For your entertainment, I've already provided the game logic.
But the hangman picture could really use your Julia drawing skills.
Can you even think of ways to modify the game itself?

But don't get hung up too much ;-)
