# Styling notebooks with CSS

Are you looking bring your notebook presentation to the next level? Do you want to change the way Pluto looks for you? Do you want special formatting for your cell output?

This is the notebook for you! We'll talk about how to style the notebook page using CSS. Let's get started!

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for _cascading style sheets_ and it's the language we use to describe what web content should look like.

A typical web page is written in HTML. HTML is essentially text with tags, which your browser is able to make sense of. For example:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 0bbfdbd5-91cd-4faf-98ef-ed2401c7de15
html"""
<p>I like <i>apples</i>... </p>
<p>but I don't like <b>oranges</b>.</p>
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° df764c10-adc0-4552-b1cf-a77afb9fbe27
md"""
In this case, `<p>`, `<i>`, and `<b>` are tags. When your browser displays this text, it understands that when you use the `<i>` tag, it should be displayed in a particular way - in this case, by writing the text in italics.
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 4812a04f-0e9f-484f-9253-cef3b3667a23
md"""
A CSS stylesheet is what we use to control exactly what each element should look like.

It lists _selectors_ for elements in the HTML content and then describes the desired look of those elements.

Here is an example. We have some text:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° d6c7985c-ff4b-4799-951f-093bfe920f98
html"""
I don't like <span id="orange">oranges</span>!
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 30e31be7-8aa1-4a00-913d-7af3388d71b2
md"""
And here is a stylesheet:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° e70d7a55-7eff-4c29-9af2-3288d99fb37c
html"""
<style>
	#orange {
		color: orange;
	}
</style>
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° cdf0c733-bbf0-4e2f-832b-19e13e7fe561
md"""
What's happening here?

- Our first cell contains the tag `<span>`. A span is a _generic_ element that just tags a selection of text. It doesn't really do anything.
- The span tag includes another attribute: `id="orange"`. That's a way of giving a unique name to this element.
- We then write some style rules in a `<style>` tag. We added a rule with the _selector_ `#orange`. That means we want to select elements that have `orange` as their ID.
- The content of our rule, between the `{}`, describes what the selected element should look like. In this case, we say it should be written in orange.

### Exercise: do it yourself

üëâ **Your turn!** The cell below should be a demonstration of different things you can do with CSS, but the rules are all mixed up! Update the stylesheet so each rule is applied to the right selector.
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° e6f1b9dc-8243-4d11-bd21-aa37396cb1e7
html"""
We can use also CSS to <span id="section-1">underline</span> text, or to make it very <span id="section-2">small</span> or <span id="section-3">big</span>. Or you can write text in <span id="section-4">all caps</span>. And you can change both the <span id="section-5">text colour</span> and <span id="section-6">background colour</span>.

<style>
	#section-1 {
		text-decoration: underline;
	}

	#section-2 {
		background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3);
	}

	#section-3 {
		color: red;
	}

	#section-4 {
		font-size: x-large;
	}

	#section-5 {
		font-size: x-small;
	}

	#section-6 {
		text-transform: uppercase;
	}
</style>

## CSS selectors

So far we've used the `id` of elements to describe what they should look like. That's a fine way to do things if we want to style a specific element, like the output of a single cell.

But a lot of the time, we want to write more _general_ rules that describe the overall layout of the page, like "every code cell should have a blue background" or "images should have a margin of 100 pixels".

Luckily, CSS selectors can do a lot more than selecting elements by their ID. Let's go over the fundamentals.
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 4a0aaf47-3685-4b01-bd57-f1ea0a09d01a
html"""
We've already seen one type of selector: <span id="special-element">selecting the id of the element</span>.

<style>
	/* hashtag for ID selection */
	#special-element {
		text-decoration: underline wavy;
	}
</style>
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 8c0bd2dd-f819-4f77-ba27-23119a216636
html"""
You can also select the <special-element>name of the tag</special-element>. This is useful for very generic selectors, like "any paragraph".

<style>
	/* no special character for the tag name */
	special-element {
		text-decoration: underline wavy;
	}
</style>
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° b6279fae-90fc-430f-bcb6-1d79f0e98fba
html"""
<p>
	Sometimes we want something a bit more fine-tuned than the element type: not all paragraphs, but some of them. We can't use IDs here: those are meant to be unique.
</p>

<p>
	In this case, we usually use the <code>class</code> attribute. That's a way of saying a bunch of elements belong to a particular category. Then you can <span class="special-element">select elements of a class</span>.
</p>

<style>
	/* use a dot for class names */
	.special-element {
		text-decoration: underline wavy;
	}
</style>
"""

Alright, so we can select by the element type, the unique ID of the element, or the class name we assign to the element. We can also combine selectors!

If this was all new to you so far, there is a lot more you can do with CSS - much more than we can cover in this notebook.

Luckily, CSS is widely used to there are plenty of tutorials available. I frequently use [MDN's CSS guide and reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)!

### Styling specific cells

If you want to add some styling to the output of specific styles, it's good to avoid statements that can accidentally affect the whole page.

A good way to do this is to wrap your cell in a tag with a `class` or `id`. Then when you write rules for that cell, write all your rules within that class or ID.

	We used `<div>` as the top-level tag in these examples. `<div>` stands for division: it's a generic element meant to divide the content of a page into parts without really saying anything else about what those parts are for - it's a suitable generic wrapper for cell output.

## Styling Pluto

What if we _don't_ want to style specific cells?

Sometimes it's useful to style the entire page. For instance, you could change the layout of a notebook for a presentation to show bigger text or hide the live docs. Or maybe you just have a personal preference to show all text in purple!

We've already seen that `<style>` elements can modify anything on the page. If we want to style Pluto, though, we need to know how to select specific elements.

If you're not familiar with [browser developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools), those are going to be a huge help with this. You can use the developer tools to inspect elements and see the element and class names that Pluto uses.

For example, here we can set the header background colour of the "help" menu:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 838600d7-1965-445d-ab79-cc81866eca24
html"""
<style>
	pluto-helpbox header {
		/* uncomment the line below to see the effect! */
		/* background-color: red; */
	}
</style>
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° d9ac05cc-3c54-46fc-bf28-ad38418fe413
md"""
Keep in mind that Pluto doesn't guarantee a stable API for styling. That is to say, new versions of Pluto might change class names or element names, or just slightly restyle the page in a way that messes up your own styling rules.

That said, Pluto has been around for a while, so you can expect it to be reasonably stable.
