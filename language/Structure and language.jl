In this notebook, we will look at a particular type of data: **written text** in **natural language**. (The word "natural" here is to distinguish human (natural) languages from computer languages.)

In computational fields, dealing with data often means finding structure. Human speech or text is a big, complicated mess that we understand intuitively, but which is very difficult to explain to a computer.

One approach is to create a **grammar**: a formal system of rules that describes things like what order words can appear in, and how that translates to meaning. Those rules have to be written by humans, which turns out to be very difficult.

The other approach is to rely on **statistics**: we use a lot of real text as our starting point, and try to identify quantitative patterns in the text. Or preferably, we let our computer identify patterns for us 😉

Statistical approaches have made huge advances over the past few decades, and are a key component of state-of-the-art developments in artificial intelligence.

In this notebook, we'll use statistical patterns to analyse text, as well as generate some text of our own. To do this, we'll need to find some sort of structure in all those words...

!!! info "A bit of theory: what is a language model?"

	What does it mean to make a model of a language?

	Formally, we usually define a [language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) as something that gives you a _probability_ for a piece of text. That is to say, if we've built a model of the English language, we can give it a piece of text like `"I'm drinking tea"`, and it will tell us how likely it is that a random piece of English text is that exact sequence of characters.
	
	That may seem a bit limited: shouldn't a model be about other things, too? Shouldn't it describe grammar, or tell you what words mean?
	
	Well, a really advanced probabilistic model should do all of that. It should tell you that `"drinking tea I'm"` is less likely, because that is not a valid word order in English. And it should also know that `"I'm drinking pizza"` is less likely, because pizza isn't something you can drink.
	
	And importantly, such a model turns out to be quite useful. Technologies like language detection and spelling checkers essentially need to say: does this bit of text look like normal English text? When we want to generate text, we can use the model to ask: what is the most likely text here?

That already looks a lot better than our first attempt! But it still does not look like English text -- we can do better. 

### Frequency table

English words are not well modelled by this random-Latin-characters model. Our first observation is that **some letters are more common than others**. To put this observation into practice, we would like to have the **frequency table** of the Latin alphabet. We could search for it online, but it is actually very simple to calculate ourselves! The only thing we need is a _representative sample_ of English text.

The following samples are from Wikipedia, but feel free to type in your own sample! You can also enter a sample of a different language, if that language can be expressed in the Latin alphabet.

Remember that the $(html"<img src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ionic-team/ionicons@5.0.0/src/svg/eye-outline.svg' style='width: 1em; height: 1em; margin-bottom: -.2em;'>") button on the left of a cell will show or hide the code.

We also include a sample of Spanish, which we'll use later!

#### Exercise 1.1 - _Data cleaning_
Looking at the sample, we see that it is quite _messy_: it contains punctuation, accented letters and numbers. For our analysis, we are only interested in our 27-character alphabet (i.e. `'a'` through `'z'` plus `' '`). We are going to clean the data using the Julia function `filter`. 
"""

`filter` takes two arguments: a **function** and a **collection**. The function is applied to each element of the collection, and it must return either `true` or `false` for each element. If the result is `true`, then that element is included in the final collection.

Did you notice something cool? Functions are also just _objects_ in Julia, and you can use them as arguments to other functions! _(Fons thinks this is super cool.)_

We have written a function `isinalphabet`, which takes a character and returns a boolean:

We are not interested in the capitalization of letters (i.e. `'A'` vs `'a'`), so we want to *map* these to lower case _before_ we apply our filter. If we don't, all upper case letters would get deleted.

Julia has a `map` function to do exactly this. Like `filter`, its first argument is the function we want to apply to each element of the second argument.

Finally, we need to deal with **accents**: simply deleting accented characters from the source text might deform it too much. We can add accented letters to our alphabet, but a simpler solution is to *replace* accented letters with the corresponding unaccented base character. We have written a function `unaccent` that does just that.

Although the word forest is commonly used, there is no universally recognised precise definition, with more than 800 definitions of forest used around the world.[4] Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees, under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past, will grow trees in the future,[9] or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type.[10][11]
	
The word forest derives from the Old French forest (also forès), denoting "forest, vast expanse covered by trees"; forest was first introduced into English as the word denoting wild land set aside for hunting[14] without the necessity in definition of having trees on the land.[15] Possibly a borrowing, probably via Frankish or Old High German, of the Medieval Latin foresta, denoting "open wood", Carolingian scribes first used foresta in the Capitularies of Charlemagne specifically to denote the royal hunting grounds of the King. The word was not endemic to Romance languages, e. g. native words for forest in the Romance languages derived from the Latin silva, which denoted "forest" and "wood(land)" (confer the English sylva and sylvan); confer the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese selva; the Romanian silvă; and the Old French selve, and cognates in Romance languages, e. g. the Italian foresta, Spanish and Portuguese floresta, etc., are all ultimately derivations of the French word.

Un bosque es un ecosistema donde la vegetación predominante la constituyen los árboles y matas.1​ Estas comunidades de plantas cubren grandes áreas del globo terráqueo y funcionan como hábitats para los animales, moduladores de flujos hidrológicos y conservadores del suelo, constituyendo uno de los aspectos más importantes de la biosfera de la Tierra. Aunque a menudo se han considerado como consumidores de dióxido de carbono atmosférico, los bosques maduros son prácticamente neutros en cuanto al carbono, y son solamente los alterados y los jóvenes los que actúan como dichos consumidores.2​3​ De cualquier manera, los bosques maduros juegan un importante papel en el ciclo global del carbono, como reservorios estables de carbono y su eliminación conlleva un incremento de los niveles de dióxido de carbono atmosférico.

Los bosques pueden hallarse en todas las regiones capaces de mantener el crecimiento de árboles, hasta la línea de árboles, excepto donde la frecuencia de fuego natural es demasiado alta, o donde el ambiente ha sido perjudicado por procesos naturales o por actividades humanas. Los bosques a veces contienen muchas especies de árboles dentro de una pequeña área (como la selva lluviosa tropical y el bosque templado caducifolio), o relativamente pocas especies en áreas grandes (por ejemplo, la taiga y bosques áridos montañosos de coníferas). Los bosques son a menudo hogar de muchos animales y especies de plantas, y la biomasa por área de unidad es alta comparada a otras comunidades de vegetación. La mayor parte de esta biomasa se halla en el subsuelo en los sistemas de raíces y como detritos de plantas parcialmente descompuestos.

In this exercise, we will use our model to write a **classifier**: a program that automatically classifies a text as either $(join(string.(fieldnames(typeof(samples))), " or ")). 

This is not a difficult task -- you can download dictionaries for both languages, and count matches -- but we are doing something much more exciting: we only use a single paragraph of each language, and we use a _language model_ as classifier.

## **Exercise 2** - _Language generation_

Our model from Exercise 1 has the property that it can easily be 'reversed' to _generate_ text. While this is useful to demonstrate its structure, the produced text is mostly meaningless: it fails to generate real words, let alone sentences.

To take our model one step further, we are going to _generalize_ what we have done so far. Instead of looking at _letter combinations_, we will model _word combinations_.  And instead of analyzing the frequencies of bigrams (combinations of two letters), we are going to analyze _$n$-grams_.

#### Dataset
This also means that we are going to need a larger dataset to train our model on: the number of English words (and their combinations) is much higher than the number of letters.

We will train our model on the novel [_Emma_ (1815), by Jane Austen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_(novel)). This work is in the public domain, which means that we can download the whole book as a text file from `archive.org`. We've done the process of downloading and cleaning already, and we have split the text into word and punctuation tokens.

First, here is a function that takes an array, and returns the array of all **neighbour pairs** from the original. For example,

```julia
bigrams([1, 2, 3, 42])

#### Exercise 2.2 - _frequency matrix revisisted_
In Exercise 1 we use a 2D array to store the bigram frequencies, where each column or row corresponds to a character from the alphabet. To use trigrams we could store the frequencies in a 3D array, and so on. 

However, when counting words instead of letters we run into a problem: A 3D array with one row, column and layer per word has too many elements to store on our computer!

$(html"<br>")

Although the frequency array would be very large, it is also **sparse**, meaning *most entries are zero*. For example, _"Emma"_ is a common word, but the sequence of words _"Emma Emma Emma"_ never occurs in the novel.

When a matrix is sparse in this way, we can **store the same information in a more efficient structure**. We don't need to store every combination of words that never occurred - just the ones that do!

To do this, we will use a **dictionary**, or `Dict` in Julia.

!!! info "SparseArrays?"

	Julia's [`SparseArrays.jl` package](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/SparseArrays/index.html) might sound like a logical choice, but the arrays from that package support only 1D and 2D types.

	Dictionaries are also designed to make things easy when you want to look up values by, say, a word or a sequence of words, rather than a numeric index. This will be convenient for us!

Take a close look at the next example. Note that you can click on the output to expand the data viewer.

(Did you notice something funny? The dictionary is _unordered_, this is why the entries were printed in reverse from the definition.)

You can dynamically add or change values of a `Dict` by assigning to `my_dict[key]`. You can check whether a key already exists using `haskey(my_dict, key)`.

👉 Use these two techniques to write a function `word_counts` that takes an array of words, and returns a `Dict` with entries `word => number_of_occurences`.

For example:
```julia
word_counts(["to", "be", "or", "not", "to", "be"])
```

Great! Let's get back to our n-grams. For the purpose of generating text, we are going to store a _completion cache_. This is a dictionary where each key is an $(n-1)$-gram, and the corresponding value is the vector of all those words which can complete it to an $n$-gram. Let's look at an example:

```julia
let
	words = splitwords("to be or not to be that is the question")
	trigrams = ngrams(words, 3)
	cache = completions_cache(trigrams)
	cache == Dict(
		["to", "be"] => ["or", "that"],
		["be", "or"] => ["not"],
		["or", "not"] => ["to"],
		["be", "that"] => ["is"],
		["that", "is"] => ["the"],
		["is", "the"] => ["question"]
	)
end
```

So for trigrams the keys are the first $2$ words of each trigram, and the values are arrays containing every third word of those trigrams.

If the same n-gram occurs multiple times (e.g. "said Emma laughing"), then the last word ("laughing") should also be stored multiple times. This will allow us to generate trigrams with the same frequencies as the original text.

👉 Write the function `completion_cache`, which takes an array of ngrams (i.e. an array of arrays of words, like the result of your `ngram` function), and returns a dictionary like described above.

## **Exercise 1:** _Language detection_

Let's start with some obvious structure in English text: the set of characters that we write the language in. If we generate random text by sampling (choosing) random characters (`Char` in Julia), it does not look like English:
"""

# ╔═╡ eaa8c79e-f9a2-11ea-323f-8bb2bd36e11c
md"""
$(bigbreak)
#### Exercise 1.2 - _Letter frequencies_

We are going to count the _frequency_ of each letter in this sample, after applying your `clean` function. Can you guess which character is most frequent?
"""

# ╔═╡ dcffd7d2-f9a6-11ea-2230-b1afaecfdd54
md"""
$(bigbreak)
Now that we know the frequencies of letters in English, we can generate random text that already looks closer to English!

**Random letters from the alphabet:**
"""

# ╔═╡ 77623f3e-f9a9-11ea-2f46-ff07bd27cd5f
md"""
$(bigbreak)
#### Exercise 1.3 - _Transition frequencies_
In the previous exercise we computed the frequency of each letter in the sample by _counting_ their occurences, and then dividing by the total number of counts.

In this exercise, we are going to count _letter transitions_, such as `aa`, `as`, `rt`, `yy`. Two letters might both be common, like `a` and `e`, but their combination, `ae`, is uncommon in English. 

To quantify this observation, we will do the same as in our last exercise: we count occurences in a _sample text_, to create the **transition frequency matrix**.
