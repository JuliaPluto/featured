# Pluto for scientists 🧪

If you write code for academic research and you're wondering what Pluto has to offer, this notebook is for you!

We'll explore some of Pluto's strength from the perspective of _scientists_  and _research software developers_! 👩‍🔬 We'll discuss what Pluto can do, and show off some things using a small physics experiment as an example.


!!! question "Is this for me?"
	
	This notebook doesn't require _any_ knowledge of Pluto or Julia, but we assume that you have written research software outside of Pluto.

	If you're completely new to programming, you may find it more useful to come back to this notebook after you have done a few tutorials and written some code of your own.

## Explain your theories

Going from intricate theories and formulas to code often takes quite a bit of translation. Notebooks are great for science because you can explain your ideas right next to the code.

It's particularly useful that you can also write LaTeX formulas!

Our example will concern the mechanics of a _pendulum_. Let's start by laying out the theory!

!!! info "The duration of a pendulum swing"

	📚 *This explanation is based on [Pendulum mechanics (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_(mechanics))*

	The duration of one pendulum swing (``T``) depends on the length of the pendulum (``L``), the gravity constant (``g``), and the angle at the highest point (``\theta_0``).
	
	However, if ``\theta_0`` is small (that is, if the pendulum does not have a wide swing), it will have a negligible effect on the system, so we can leave it out of our equation.
	
	This "small-angle approximation" of a pendulum uses the following formula:
	
	``
	T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
	``

## Visualise your data

One of the great things about working in notebooks is that you can instantly _visualise_ your data. 📈

Visualising while you work is incredibly useful in gaining insight, spotting abnormalities, and discovering trends. A useful aspect of notebooks is that you can view visualisations right alongside your code!

!!! info "The pendulum experiment"

	Measuring the swing of a pendulum is a good experiment to do at home or in classrooms, because it doesn't require special materials.

	To collect this data, I used:
	- a cotton rope (you can use any non-elastic rope)
	- a small weight to tie at the bottom (I used a bicycle spoke wrench, because it was what was around)
	- something to hang the pendulum from (I used a ceiling lamp)
	- a stopwatch (I used my phone)
	- ideally, some tape

	I tied one end of the rope to the ceiling lamp and one end to the weight. I then measured the length of the rope.

	I used some tape to mark where I wanted to stand and where the resting position of the rope was. (If I stood at the marked point and the pendulum was hanging still, it would be exactly in front of the tape.)

	To measure the duration of the swing, I pulled the pendulum to one side and let it swing. I started the stopwatch when it passed through the middle, and let it swing back and forth five times. When it passed through the middle after the fifth swing, I stopped the stopwatch and noted the time.
	
	I did this five times and noted the time for each.
	
	I then adjusted and cut the rope to the pendulum was a bit shorter, repeated my measurements, and did that several times so I would have measurements for several lengths of rope.

!!! info "Finding g"

	We'll try to find the optimal value for ``g``; that is, the one where our model best matches the data from our experiment.

	We'll use a fairly simple method of approximation. Based on our visualiastions, we give a _lower_ and _upper_ bound for ``g``: we know it's somewhere between those values.

	Then, we take a sample of 50 values between those ends (spread out uniformly), and return the one where we get the closest fit to our observations.

	We'll compare the predictions with the observations by taking the absolute error in each datapoint, and taking the sum of all those. So if ``p`` is the vector of all predictions, and ``o`` the vector of all observations, the error is defined as
	
	``
	\text{E} = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n}{p_i - o_i}

## Run your code as a script

It often makes sense to develop a model in a notebook and visualise it on some example data, and then train the model on the real data, which may take a long time.  Perhaps this is the kind of thing where you want to run a training script on a remote server where you only have a command line to work with.

At this point, it will come in handy that _Pluto notebooks are also Julia scripts!_ If you have created a notebook `my_model.jl`, you can run it from the command line with `julia my_model.jl`. Similarly, it's no problem to import Pluto notebooks inside "regular" Julia scripts!

So if you have developed your notebook with example data on your own laptop, you can move it to a remote server and run it from there. Or you can work in a notebook to define a `train_model(data)` function, and then write a small script that imports `train_model` and runs it on the big dataset. 🚀

### Disable in File
The function **Disable in File** can be really useful for this! (Edit this notebook and press the `(...)` context menu of this cell.) This makes the cell run in your notebook, but stored as a comment in the Julia file. This lets you have cells that are useful for visualisation (like a plot), that are not executed when you `include` the notebook file somewhere else. 

**Disable in File** is also reactive: if you disable a cell, then all cells that depend on it will also get disabled automatically. This is really handy: often you can just disable the cell that loads your dataset, and then any cell that uses your data will be excluded, while your helper functions are still available!

## Share your work

You've developed some exciting algorithms, trained a model on real data, created visualisations, and you're ready to share your work with the world. Great!

You can polish your Pluto notebooks into accessible, interesting, comprehensive explanations of your work. We've seen some of this already: adding explanations and formulas, visualisations, and spicing it up with some interactions.

When you're getting your notebook ready for the world, you can also hide the output or the code of some cells (or both), or rearrange the order of cells. For instance, you can move "utility code" to the bottom of the notebook.

But now that we have this nicely polished notebook, what can we do with it?

While some of your colleagues will be interested to run your Pluto notebooks themselves (more on that later), you also want to share your code with people who don't have Pluto installed. How can they see your process?

### Record *(preview)*

Pluto has a special feature: *recording mode*. It works quite similar to a screen recording: you click *record*, and you can move sliders, make code changes, and scroll around the notebook. If you enable microphone access, then you can tell a story! 

The result is a video where people can play back what you demonstrated! Watch [this recording of *unitful sliders*](https://plutojl.org/unitful%20sliders/) to see an example.

But unlike a regular screen recorder, the output file is not exactly a video (`.mp4` or `.mov`), but an HTML file (`.html`)! When people open the file, it will look exactly like a video player, but it's actually **Pluto magic**! Pluto didn't record the screen, but it recorded all *state changes*, and it can play them back in the static preview. This means that:
- While watching the video, you can **scroll around**: you are not limited to watching the frame that was recorded.
- You can watch the video with your own screen size! And it looks super sharp!
- The **file size is tiny** compared to a video! That's because we only need to store text, data and audio.

#### Future work
The **Record** feature is still in preview. We are still working on two things:
- Recording your cursor and changes as you type.
- An easy way to share HTML files. We are working on a website to share and view recording files!

### Presentation mode

You can use Pluto notebooks to give presentations!

You can use the "export..." menu to switch Pluto to "presentation mode" (and to switch it back to normal). When you're presenting, Pluto puts some spacing between the headers and you will get some navigation buttons to jump from header to header.

This may be enough for a simple lecture, or you could add special formatting to create a really flashy presentation. For making basic presentations, Pluto isn't going to win out over dedicated presentation software in terms of usability, but being able to present from a running notebook offers new options!

If you're interested in giving presentations or lectures with _interactive_ presentations of your research, or where you can quickly type in some code when you're answering a question, Pluto's presentation mode is a great option!

## Reproducible code

Once you've presented and publish your work, how does your code fare?

_Reproducability_ is incredibly important in academia. It's how we can verify research, and how we can build on it. When you're putting your own research software out in the world, you want people to be able to run it!

Pluto is designed to be reproducible by default!

A big part of this is the _built-in package manager_. 📦 When you import packages in Pluto, the notebook file will write down the exact versions of the packages that you used. When someone else opens your notebook in Pluto, they will use the exact same package environment, without even thinking about it!

!!! question "What if they don't use Pluto?"
	
	If the scientists from the future don't use Pluto, they won't benefit from the built-in package manager, but they can still check your notebook file for the versions of packages that you used. Neat!
