Are you adding a notebook to the featured notebooks? Here's what you need to know!

## Licensing

All notebooks MUST have an [OSI-approved licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/) or a [creative commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/). Whether a software licence or a creative licence is more appropriate for your notebook is up to you.

We like to use the [Unlicense](https://opensource.org/license/unlicense/) for sample notebooks, but you're free to pick a different one!

### Adding licence info to your notebook

First, specify the license in the frontmatter of your notebook. Add a `license` field with the name of your licence, and a `license_url` field with a link to the full text.

If the full text is already listed in [LICENSES](LICENSES/), you can link to that file. If not, we recommend that you add it to LICENSES yourself, so it will always be availalbe with the notebook, but you can also link to an external URL.

The Unlicense is a *public domain-equivalent* license, which means gives permission to share and reuse the code without any restrictions. There are a few other licenses like this, such as MIT No Attribution and CC-0. If you're using a license that isn't like this, add a clear paragraph in the content of your notebook to say this.
